                Hello, everyone. Welcome to my homepage! I divid my introduction into four parts--my homepage, my family and hometown,
                my university, my daily study. I come from a small but beautiful countryside named WanQuan in Jingzhou HuBei province.
                both my mother and father are farmer, besides I have a sister who has married and got a lovely baby last year. I have a very
                happy family.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from Huazhong university of science and technology and got my bachelor's degree of software engineering, however,
                the curriculum of computer science teached in China is so boring and useless, once I even doubt if i am suitable for majoring
                in computer science. luckily, I read a book called <a href="https://csdiy.wiki/">csdiy</a> written by a student from Pku university.
                he collect many foreign highly qualified curiculum including CS50, that's why I am here. so I decided to follow this book,
                finish some main basic and practical class to design my computer science for myself. I want to rebuild myself, and I want to
                say <strong>"fuck you, garbage china computer science education!</strong>"
            </p>
            <p>
                I haven't seen a teacher who can teach a class for about two and a half hours and only rest 10 minutes in the midium with
                his enthusiasm and passion, his class is so exciting and the knowledge is so clear
